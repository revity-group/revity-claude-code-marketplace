# Conventional Commit

<git_status>
!`git status`
</git_status>

<staged_diff>
!`git diff --cached`
</staged_diff>

<unstaged_diff>
!`git diff`
</unstaged_diff>

<recent_commits>
!`git log --oneline -5`
</recent_commits>

## Instructions

Review the changes above and commit using conventional commit format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`

Scope: Use folder/feature name (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`). Omit if change is broad.

For breaking changes, add `!` after type: `feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoint`

If changes are unrelated, split into logical commits. Otherwise, one commit is fine.

Never mention AI / Claude in the commit message.

### Staging

- If changes are already staged, commit only what's staged
- If nothing is staged, review unstaged changes carefully before staging
- Avoid `git add -A` if sensitive files (.env, credentials) might be included

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```
